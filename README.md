# GoWeather
Retrieving weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) current weather data API.

This is my first project using Go. I'm currently still working on it, but once it's finished you will be able to use it (with your own API key of course!) to import weather information into your scripts. I'm personally planning on using it to power a custom module for a [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar).
